# Unemployment Analysis During Covid-19

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the unemployment rate during the Covid-19 pandemic using Python and data science techniques. It was completed as part of my internship at Oasis Infobyte, where I explored trends, visualized data, and derived insights to understand the impact of the pandemic on employment.

## Key Features
- **Data Exploration**: Analyzed historical and real-time unemployment data.
- **Data Visualization**: Used matplotlib and seaborn to create insightful visualizations.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Implemented statistical models to forecast unemployment trends.
- **Python Programming**: Leveraged pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn for data manipulation and analysis.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains datasets used for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks detailing data analysis steps and findings.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing and modeling.
- `results/`: Output files and visualizations.

## Getting Started
To run the notebooks and scripts:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shrol69/unemployment_covid-19.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd unemployment_covid-19
```
3. Explore the analysis in the `notebooks/` directory.

## Project Status
This project is completed and serves as a demonstration of my skills in data analysis and Python programming.
